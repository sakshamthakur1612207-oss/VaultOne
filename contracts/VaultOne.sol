    Owner can burn tokens from an account
    function burn(address account, uint256 amount) external onlyOwner {
        require(account != address(0), "Burn from zero address");
        uint256 burnAmount = amount * 10**decimals;
        require(balances[account] >= burnAmount, "Burn amount exceeds balance");

        balances[account] -= burnAmount;
        totalSupply -= burnAmount;

        emit Transfer(account, address(0), burnAmount);
